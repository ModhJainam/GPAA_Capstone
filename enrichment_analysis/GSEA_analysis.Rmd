This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
BiocManager::install("fgsea")
BiocManager::install("gage")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
DE_genes = read.csv("/project/gpaa/machine_learning/jainam_capstone/differential_expression/noconfound_LAD_DE_results.csv", row.names = 'X')
x <- strsplit(rownames(DE_genes), "[|]")
gene_list = DE_genes$log2FoldChange
names(gene_list) = sapply(x, "[", 2)
gene_list = sort(gene_list, decreasing = TRUE)
gene_list = gene_list[!duplicated(names(gene_list))]
head(gene_list)
```

```{r}
GO_file = "c5.go.bp.v7.5.1.symbols.gmt"
source("GSEA_function.R")
res = GSEA(gene_list, GO_file, pval = 0.05)
```

```{r fig.asp = 0.5, fig.width = 20}
res$Plot + theme(text = element_text(size=14))
```
```{r}F
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
